# Housing-Price-Prediction-Project
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis of housing price dataset and linear regression for predicting house prices.
##Features:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : We start by performing comprehensive EDA on the housing dataset. This involves examining the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, checking for missing values, and exploring correlations between features. EDA helps us gain insights into the data and make informed decisions during the model development process.
2. Linear Regression : To predict the house prices based on their features we use Linear Regression.
