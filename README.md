# Housing-Price-Prediction-Project
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis of housing price dataset and using Machine Learning algorithms to predict accurate housing prices.

## Features
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : we start by performing comprehensive EDA on the housing dataset. This involves examining the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, checking for missing values, and exploring correlations between features. EDA helps us gain insights into the data and make informed decisions during the model development process.
2. Data Preprocessing : In the data preprocessing phase, I employed various techniques to handle different types of variables, utilising one-hot encoding for nominal variables, label encoding for ordinal variables, and standard scaling for numerical variables. Additionally, I applied PCA for dimensionality reduction to reduce the complexity of the dataset. These steps ensured appropriate data transformation and preparation, setting the foundation for accurate and effective modeling.
3. Model Deploymetn : During the model deployment phase, I implemented three algorithms, namely Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict housing prices. After evaluation, both Linear Regression and Random Forest demonstrated an accuracy of 83%, highlighting their strong performance in capturing the complex relationships within the dataset and producing reliable predictions.
